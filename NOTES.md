# Architecture:
## Sub-applications:
- Renderer
- Zones
 - ZoneRegistry
  - use GenServer
  - Can map from any Zone to all connected Zones
  - Zones arranged in arbitrary graph
 - Zone
  - macro-module
  - use Agent
  - Knows what Objects are in it
   - (pid and tags)
  - call it for contained Objects (of specific kind)
  - Has a list of atoms as tags
- Objects
 - ObjectRegistry
  - use GenServer
 - Object
  - macro-module
  - use Agent
  - Created in/by a Zone, store pid of that Zone
  - State is a map, which can include tags (atom mapping to true)
  - Has a list of functions following Rule API
  - Has an automatic update function
  - Responds to messages passed from UI forwarder
- Rule system
 - Rule API
  - foo({:tag, pid}, {:tag, pid}, :samezone) # (or :connzone)
  - Given two objects with specific tags, call some specified functions
  - Very open-ended
  - Each update, all Zones try to call rules for all object pairs
  - Game should have a single Rules module to leverage pattern-matching
- UI Forwarder
 - Send messages to object manager containing keyboard input
  - Not bothering with other input devices for the first version
